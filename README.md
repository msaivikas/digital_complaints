# digital_complaints

Purpose : A website where students can register their complaints online instead of going to the office room 

Django has been used to create the website. Default database, SQLite has been used. Basic-level CSS has been used for the front-end part.

Issues remaining:
1. Login system is not working properly. Currently, any user can edit with any other user's complaints. 
2. After finishing the back end, bootstrap can be used to style the website to look good.
